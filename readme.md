# Project Movie Trailer Website

These are the files for the Project 1 on the Fullstack Dev Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project you just need any version of Python (2 or 3). Just regular Python libraries are used (webbrowser, os and re). Just download all the files to the same folder.

### Prerequisites

Here are the files that should be on the same folder:

entertainment_center.py - Main file that should be run. Also contains the list of movies along with pictures and descriptions that are going to be displayed.

media.py file contains the Movie class which we're going to use along the file.

fresh_tomatoes.py file will create the .html with our Movie objects

### Installing and Running

Once all files are on the same folder, just type on the command prompt (or terminal for Mac OS):

```
python entertainment_center.py
```

A brand new "fresh_tomatoes.html" file will be created with the movies that are on the entertainment_center.py file

Feel free to change the movies on the entertainment_center.py file and watch the results!!!
